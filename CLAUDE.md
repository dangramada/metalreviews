# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Working conventions

- Always read the Working conventions, Commands, and Active branches sections fully before
  starting any task; consult the historical/reference section below only when the task at
  hand touches it
- Always show a plan and wait for approval before writing code
- After each completed feature, update this file (or the relevant `docs/decisions/` file — see below) with decisions made
- Target deployment: Render (current). Vercel migration is a possible future move — avoid permanent server dependencies where reasonably easy
- Comment all non-trivial code: explain WHY, not just what. Prioritise scraper logic, ingestion pipeline, React state, and any API or browser quirks.
- When a session identifies new deferred or postponed work, add it to `docs/decisions/deferred-work.md` rather than only stating it inline in that session's own doc.
- Docs that are read repeatedly across sessions and grow large after a decision ships get a
  short summary block prepended once shipped-and-verified, so future sessions can skip the
  full body (currently done for `ingest-trigger-and-security.md` and
  `unknown-band-collision-audit.md`). Apply this only when a doc is both large and frequently
  re-read — not as a default for every decision doc.
- Periodically (roughly monthly) review `deferred-work.md` for shipped items older than
  ~30 days whose full detail already lives in a decision doc, and compress them to one-liners.
- Commit at the end of each individual pass in a multi-pass effort, not only at the very end —
  uncommitted work across many passes has no real save point.
- A shipped feature's top-of-file "✅ COMPLETE" narrative is temporary, not permanent — once its
  immediate follow-on work is done, collapse it into a single line in the Past-decisions index,
  same as everything else. The decision doc keeps full detail regardless; only the
  mandatory-read copy shrinks.
- File order matters: operationally-relevant content (conventions, commands, active branch
  state) comes first, since every session reads it. Historical completion narratives and the
  Past-decisions index go last — reference material, read only when the task at hand needs it.
- **Branch lifecycle**: a merged branch (`--no-ff`) may be deleted, local + remote, once
  >=14 days have passed since its merge date — safety rests on the merge commit's first
  parent (always the pre-merge rollback point) plus the `docs/decisions/branch-log.md`
  entry as the durable record, not on keeping the ref. Review cadence: folded into the
  existing roughly-monthly `deferred-work.md` review — same session, check
  `branch-log.md` for anything >=14 days past merge, delete what qualifies. Exception: a
  branch ref confirmed stale (behind master — master has commits not reachable from the
  branch) is deleted regardless of age, since a stale ref is actively misleading rather
  than "not yet due." Branches that were never merged (rejected/abandoned work) are
  **not** covered by this automatic policy — deleting them loses code that exists
  nowhere else, so each such branch is a separate, explicit decision. On deletion,
  append a note to the branch's `branch-log.md` line rather than removing the line.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev           # Start Vite dev server + Express API server together (via concurrently)
npm run build         # Build frontend for production
npm run ingest        # Run the scraper/ingestion pipeline locally (one-off). In production, ingest is triggered by a GitHub Actions schedule + workflow_dispatch calling POST /api/ingest — see docs/decisions/ingest-trigger-and-security.md
npm run server        # Start Express API server alone (port 3001)
npm run test          # Run all tests (Vitest, watch mode)
npm run lint          # ESLint check
npm run lint:fix      # ESLint auto-fix
npm run format        # Prettier format
npm run type-check    # TypeScript check without emitting
```

Run a single test file:

```bash
npx vitest run src/__tests__/angrymetal.test.js
```

## Active branches

For the full branch history (including merged branches), see
`docs/decisions/branch-log.md`.

(No branches currently active. Update this section, not individual decision docs, when a
new branch is started or a branch's status changes.)

## Completed feature narratives & Past decisions (historical/reference — read only when relevant to the task at hand)

### Slant Take design system — ✅ COMPLETE (merged 2026-07-25)

The `design-system-slant-take` branch is merged to `master` (`--no-ff`, commit `a3eeb88`). All
nine passes verified: `tsc --noEmit` clean, `npx vitest run` 171/171. Rollback tag
`pre-slant-take-design-system` remains on `master`. Branch kept, not deleted, per project
convention. Full pass-by-pass history: `docs/decisions/slant-take-design-system.md`.

### Non-review post filtering during ingest — ✅ COMPLETE, verified live (2026-07-17)

`scripts/ingest.ts` skips roundups/retrospective columns from Angry Metal Guy and The
Progressive Subway via RSS `<category>` tag checks (`isGenuineReview`/`isAllowlistedFranchise`/
`shouldSkipPost`), logging skipped posts to the `skipped_posts` Supabase table
(`supabase/skipped_posts.sql`, already run). Verified against a live `npm run ingest`: known
roundup/retrospective-column posts from both sources were skipped and logged with zero
`albums`/`reviews` rows created; normal reviews from all three sources ingested unaffected. Full
decision + rationale: `docs/decisions/roundup-skip-fix.md`. Preceded by the read-only audit in
`docs/decisions/unknown-band-collision-audit.md`.

The 3 pre-fix stale rows the audit found (including the `Unknown Band | Unknown Album` sentinel)
were separately cleaned up the same day — see `docs/decisions/stale-row-cleanup.md`.

- `criteria-calibration-score-spread-accuracy.md` — `computeSolverAccuracy` replaced by a score-spread LP metric (tracks real rank displacement through the old metric's blind spot, confirmed on oracle + real production data); old metric kept deprecated for rollback; new provisional thresholds; branch merged to `master` 2026-08-09
- `criteria-calibration-adaptive-degree-escalation.md` — design checkpoint, implemented 2026-08-10: coverage-based degree escalation (`isDegreeCoverageComplete`, `computeTouchCounts`/`.min`/`.max`) replaced the old gap-based `MAX_AMBIGUOUS_GAP` check in `elicitationDriver.ts`; also notes an unfixed LP-infeasibility bug found while diagnosing this
