# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Working conventions

- Always read the Working conventions, Commands, and Active branches sections fully before
  starting any task; consult the historical/reference section below only when the task at
  hand touches it
- Always show a plan and wait for approval before writing code
- After each completed feature, update this file (or the relevant `docs/decisions/` file — see below) with decisions made
- Target deployment: Render (current). Vercel migration is a possible future move — avoid permanent server dependencies where reasonably easy
- Comment all non-trivial code: explain WHY, not just what. Prioritise scraper logic, ingestion pipeline, React state, and any API or browser quirks.
- When a session identifies new deferred or postponed work, add it to `docs/decisions/deferred-work.md` rather than only stating it inline in that session's own doc.
- Docs that are read repeatedly across sessions and grow large after a decision ships get a
  short summary block prepended once shipped-and-verified, so future sessions can skip the
  full body (currently done for `ingest-trigger-and-security.md` and
  `unknown-band-collision-audit.md`). Apply this only when a doc is both large and frequently
  re-read — not as a default for every decision doc.
- Periodically (roughly monthly) review `deferred-work.md` for shipped items older than
  ~30 days whose full detail already lives in a decision doc, and compress them to one-liners.
- Commit at the end of each individual pass in a multi-pass effort, not only at the very end —
  uncommitted work across many passes has no real save point.
- A shipped feature's top-of-file "✅ COMPLETE" narrative is temporary, not permanent — once its
  immediate follow-on work is done, collapse it into a single line in the Past-decisions index,
  same as everything else. The decision doc keeps full detail regardless; only the
  mandatory-read copy shrinks.
- File order matters: operationally-relevant content (conventions, commands, active branch
  state) comes first, since every session reads it. Historical completion narratives and the
  Past-decisions index go last — reference material, read only when the task at hand needs it.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev           # Start Vite dev server + Express API server together (via concurrently)
npm run build         # Build frontend for production
npm run ingest        # Run the scraper/ingestion pipeline locally (one-off). In production, ingest is triggered by a GitHub Actions schedule + workflow_dispatch calling POST /api/ingest — see docs/decisions/ingest-trigger-and-security.md
npm run server        # Start Express API server alone (port 3001)
npm run test          # Run all tests (Vitest, watch mode)
npm run lint          # ESLint check
npm run lint:fix      # ESLint auto-fix
npm run format        # Prettier format
npm run type-check    # TypeScript check without emitting
```

Run a single test file:

```bash
npx vitest run src/__tests__/angrymetal.test.js
```

## Active branches

`criteria-calibration-ui` — in progress, not merged. UI-only Phase 7 screen (mock data, no scoring-engine/Supabase wiring). Two passes so far: initial build, then a revision pass adding the selection/hold/fade state machine, Progress-vs-Accuracy split, `OptionCard` (replacing the `RadioCard`-based `TradeoffCard`), and Undo/Redo. Reachable only via the dev-only `/criteria-calibration` route — no navigation entry point yet (separate IA decision). Full detail: `docs/decisions/criteria-calibration-ui.md`.

`design-system-slant-take` merged to `master` on 2026-07-25 (see the historical section below) — branch retained per convention, not deleted. Naming note: the rename shipped in that effort supersedes the formal naming gates (friend test, domain check, trademark search) rather than completing them — see `docs/decisions/naming-decisions.md`'s 2026-07-25 entry. Still outstanding: favicon (stale, predates the design system), and the domain/GitHub-repo/Render-service name (still literally "metalreviews" — infra-level, not touched).

`album-identity-migration` merged to `master` on 2026-07-15 (see `docs/decisions/album-identity-migration.md` in the Past-decisions index) — branch retained per convention, not deleted.

(Update this section, not individual decision docs, when branch status changes.)

## Completed feature narratives & Past decisions (historical/reference — read only when relevant to the task at hand)

### Slant Take design system — ✅ COMPLETE (merged 2026-07-25)

The `design-system-slant-take` branch is merged to `master` (`--no-ff`, commit `a3eeb88`). All
nine passes verified: `tsc --noEmit` clean, `npx vitest run` 171/171. Rollback tag
`pre-slant-take-design-system` remains on `master`. Branch kept, not deleted, per project
convention. Full pass-by-pass history: `docs/decisions/slant-take-design-system.md`.

### Non-review post filtering during ingest — ✅ COMPLETE, verified live (2026-07-17)

`scripts/ingest.ts` skips roundups/retrospective columns from Angry Metal Guy and The
Progressive Subway via RSS `<category>` tag checks (`isGenuineReview`/`isAllowlistedFranchise`/
`shouldSkipPost`), logging skipped posts to the `skipped_posts` Supabase table
(`supabase/skipped_posts.sql`, already run). Verified against a live `npm run ingest`: known
roundup/retrospective-column posts from both sources were skipped and logged with zero
`albums`/`reviews` rows created; normal reviews from all three sources ingested unaffected. Full
decision + rationale: `docs/decisions/roundup-skip-fix.md`. Preceded by the read-only audit in
`docs/decisions/unknown-band-collision-audit.md`.

The 3 pre-fix stale rows the audit found (including the `Unknown Band | Unknown Album` sentinel)
were separately cleaned up the same day — see `docs/decisions/stale-row-cleanup.md`.

### Past decisions (load only when relevant)

Detailed rationale, gotchas, and "what NOT to change" notes for completed features live in `docs/decisions/`. **Read the matching file before changing related code** — don't rely on memory of past sessions for these areas:
